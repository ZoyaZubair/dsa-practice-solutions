# Notes: Intuition and Approach

### Step-by-step Intuition:

1. Calculate the maximum OR value possible from the array using:
   maxOr = nums[0] | nums[1] | ... | nums[n-1]

2. Generate all subsets using bitmasking (2^n subsets).

3. For each subset:
   - Compute the OR of elements
   - If OR == maxOr, increase the count

### Why This Works:
- OR operation is associative and accumulative.
- Bitmasking allows efficient generation of subsets up to 2^16.

### Time Complexity:
- O(n * 2^n) â€” acceptable since n <= 16
