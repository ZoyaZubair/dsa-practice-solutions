## Optimization Hint

Your current solution uses `std::set` to store unique values, which has O(log n) insertion time.

### Further Optimization:
- Replace `std::set<int>` with `std::unordered_set<int>` for average-case O(1) insertions.
- This reduces the overall time complexity from O(n log n) to O(n).

Other than that, your logic is sound and handles edge cases well.
