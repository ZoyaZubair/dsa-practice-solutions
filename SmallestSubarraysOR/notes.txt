# Notes on the Approach

- Use an array `lastSeen[32]` to track the last position each bit was seen.
- For each index from n-1 to 0:
    - Update `lastSeen` for each bit in `nums[i]`.
    - The farthest index we need to reach is max of all `lastSeen[b]`.
    - Answer for index i = maxReach - i + 1
- We only loop over 32 bits per element (constant).

Handles edge cases like:
- nums = [0, 0, 0]
- nums = [2^30]
