## Intuition

We are allowed to remove two types of substrings repeatedly: "ab" for x points, and "ba" for y points.

To maximize points, we should:
1. Always remove the higher-value substring first.
2. Then remove the lower-value one.

Why?
Because removing "ab" might prevent later removal of "ba" or vice versa. So, we greedily remove the more valuable one first using a stack, which helps check the previous character in constant time.

After removing one type, we repeat the process for the remaining string and remove the second type.
