# Pascal's Triangle - Explanation and Intuition

## Approach:
This solution uses the binomial coefficient:
C(i, j) = C(i, j-1) * (i - j + 1) / j

- `returnRows(row)` generates the `row`th row using the above formula in O(n) time.
- The outer function `generate` builds the triangle row by row.

## Time Complexity:
- O(n^2): Generating each row with up to `n` elements.

## Space Complexity:
- O(n^2): To store the full triangle.

## Advantages:
- Uses only integer operations.
- Avoids full DP table construction.
